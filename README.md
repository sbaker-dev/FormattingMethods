# LEGACY

Kept so that i can cross check against new repositories, no longer in active use.

# FormattingMethods
Just some methods that are used consistently in construction or formatting of papers or data sets for analysis. 
Separated out from multiple jupyter notebooks so that instead of duplicating and potentially having version issues there
is a single repository that can be updated for all analysis.

```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/sbaker-dev/FormattingMethods
```
